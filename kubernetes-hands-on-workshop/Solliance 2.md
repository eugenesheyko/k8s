Kubernetes Hands-on Workshop
============================

Welcome to the Kubernetes Hands-on workshop.


Our Goals
---------

Teach you the skills to leverage Docker and Kubernetes in your environment today.

Why are we learning Docker too?  The Kubernetes story begins with "so you've got a container ...".  Docker is how we build the images; Kubernetes is how we run these containers at scale.


Installation
------------

The Solliance platform has provisioned all the necessary resources.  RDP into the Azure VM, and we'll jump in.


Other Resources
---------------

If you find the guy in the front of the room particularly boring, jump into these resources:
